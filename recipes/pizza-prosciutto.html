    <p>The prosciutto and balsamic glaze give this simple white pizza a gourmet touch, but it's still easy enough to throw together on a busy weeknight.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (175 grams) ball store-bought or homemade pizza dough</li>
        <li>3 ounces burrata cheese, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 thin slices prosciutto, torn in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lightly packed arugula leaves</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat pizza oven to 800 F. See recipe variations below for using a home oven. Put the tomato paste into a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of water and salt. Stir to combine. Add a tiny bit more water to achieve a spreadable consistency.</li>
        <li>Dust the pizza peel with plenty of flour, and flour your hands. Gently stretch your pizza dough into a circle approximately 12 inches in diameter. Set it on the well-floured peel.</li>
        <li>Using the back of a spoon, gently spread your tomato sauce onto the dough. Leave the outer edge of the dough bare.</li>
        <li>Distribute the burrata evenly on the pizza. Move expeditiously. The longer the sauced dough sits on the peel, the more likely it will be to stick when you try to slide it into the oven.</li>
        <li>Put the pizza in the oven, rotating as needed. Bake until the crust has risen and the cheese is bubbly, about 2 minutes. Some light charring at the edges of the crust is excellent. Remove from oven.</li>
        <li>Layer the prosciutto and arugula evenly on the pizza. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil to taste. Top with the shaved Parmesan cheese. Slice and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
